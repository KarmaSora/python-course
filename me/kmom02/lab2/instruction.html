<h1>Lab 2 - python</h1>
<p>In this exercise we will look into flow-control. If-statements, for-loops and while-loops.</p>


<h2>1. Boolean operators and if-statements</h2>
<p>The basics of boolean operators and if-statements.</p>


<h3>Exercise 1.1 (1 points)</h3>
<p>Create three variables representing dice values: <code>dice1</code> = 2, <code>dice2</code> = 5 and <code>dice3</code> = 5.</p>

<p>Answer with the boolean value of the expression &#8216;<code>dice1</code> is greater than <code>dice2</code>&#8217;.</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.2 (1 points)</h3>
<p>Sum the three variables <code>dice1</code>, <code>dice2</code> and <code>dice3</code>.</p>

<p>Use an if-statement to decide if the sum of the three variables i greater than 11. If the sum is greater than 11 answer with &#8216;big&#8217; otherwise answer with &#8216;small&#8217;.</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.3 (1 points)</h3>
<p>Add the sum of <code>dice4</code> = 3 and <code>dice5</code> = 1 to the sum of the three other dices.</p>

<p>Use an if, elseif, else statement to check the total value of the dices. Answer with &#8216;small&#8217; if the sum is smaller than 11, &#8216;intermediate&#8217; if the sum is greater than or equal to 11 but smaller than 21. If the sum is greater than or equal to 21 answer with &#8216;big&#8217;.</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.4 (1 points)</h3>
<p>Create a variable <code>summer_word</code> containing the word &#8216;beach&#8217;.</p>

<p>Answer with True if <code>summer_word</code> contains the letter &#8216;s&#8217; otherwise answer with False.</p>

<p>Tip: Use the <code>in</code> operator.</p>







<h2>2. For-loops</h2>
<p>The basics of iteration and for-loops.</p>


<h3>Exercise 2.1 (1 points)</h3>
<p>Loop through the numbers 0 to 10 (10 included) and concatenate a string with the numbers comma-separated. You should have a comma at the end of the string.</p>

<p>Answer with the string.</p>






<h3>Exercise 2.2 (1 points)</h3>
<p>Loop through the letters of the variable <code>summer_word</code> from above. Concatenate the consonants from <code>summer_word</code> and answer with the new word.</p>

<p>Tip: Create a string that contains consonants and check if each letter is in it.</p>






<h3>Exercise 2.3 (1 points)</h3>
<p>Loop through all numbers from 50 to 84 both numbers included. Add all odd (udda) numbers together and answer with the result.</p>

<p>Tip: Use the modulus % operator.</p>







<h2>3. While-loops</h2>
<p>The basics of while-loops.</p>


<h3>Exercise 3.1 (1 points)</h3>
<p>Create a while-loop that starts at value 3 and ends when the value is greater than 25, the value should be incremented by 3 for each iteration. Concatenate a string with the values comma-separated. You should have a comma at the end of the string.</p>

<p>Answer with the string.</p>






<h3>Exercise 3.2 (1 points)</h3>
<p>Create a while-loop that subtracts 4 from 34, 28 times. Answer with the result.</p>






<h3>Exercise 3.3 (1 points)</h3>
<p>Create a while-loop that calculates the factorial number for 11, 11!. The factorial of a number is the number multiplied by all smaller integers greater than 1. The factorial of 11 is <code>11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1</code>. Answer with the result.</p>







<h2>4. Extra assignments</h2>
<p>These questions are worth 3 points each. Solve them for extra points.</p>


<h3>Exercise 4.1 (3 points)</h3>
<p>Use a for-loop or a while-loop to reverse the word &#8216;internationalization&#8217;.</p>

<p>Answer with the reversed word.</p>






<h3>Exercise 4.2 (3 points)</h3>
<p>Swedish numberplates consist of three letters and three numbers (Not using new plates which can have more letters). The numbers range from 001 to 999. Using one of the four common rules of arithmetics (+, -, *, /), on how many of the numberplates can the two first numbers give the third number? We only care about the numbers, we ignore letters for this assignment.</p>

<p>Do not count multiple times if more than one rule of arithmetics work.</p>

<p>Examples:
&#8216;123&#8217; can be combined to 1 + 2 = 3. So this numberplate is good. Since this matched on + operator, we don&#8217;t continue checking with the other operators.
&#8216;129&#8217; 1 and 2 cannot be combined to give 9 using the four rules of arithmetics, so this does not work.</p>

<p>Answer with the number of numberplates.</p>
